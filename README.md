# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate knowledge of multiple programming languages by implementing the same algorithm in all of them.
The algorithm chosen is my own understanding of solving [Sudoku puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku), with all the limitations that implies.

# Current Languages Supported

* Javascript in Browser. (See [live version](https://amcrae.github.io/SudokuJS/sudoku.html).)
* Java in a JSON ("RESTful") web service.

# Prehistory
First in December 2023 I figured out how to solve novice Sudoku puzzles with pen and paper.
About 7 months later I got more curious and figured out how to solve intermediate difficulty puzzles.
The month after that I implemented this algorithm in Javascript so it could run in the browser.
About a month later the 2nd implementation was done in Java (by porting the javascript) and was used to make a JSON web service with Spring.
The repository was then created with these 2 subprojects and the rest is commit history.
